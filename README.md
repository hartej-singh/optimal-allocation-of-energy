This project focuses on optimizing the allocation of energy between producers and consumers using a multivariate LSTM load forecasting AI model. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning, we aim to provide insights into efficient energy trading in modern energy systems.

The research begins with an exploratory data analysis, examining the correlation between weather parameters and energy consumption in households. Through the development of a forecasting methodology, historical data, weather parameters, and holiday schedules are integrated to accurately predict future energy demand.

To ensure representative results, clustering techniques are applied to group similar houses and select representative ones based on proximity to cluster centers. This approach captures the unique energy consumption patterns of different communities while maintaining an accurate representation of the overall trends.

Additionally, we address the efficient allocation of energy from the producer's perspective by evaluating the effectiveness of three algorithms: greedy fractional knapsack, genetic knapsack, and k-means knapsack. These algorithms are compared based on their ability to assign energy to clusters, considering both energy demands and wastage probabilities.

The findings demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in accurately forecasting energy consumption and optimizing energy allocation. This research contributes to improved energy management, cost savings, and sustainable practices in modern energy systems.

Overall, this offers valuable insights and a practical framework for energy providers and policymakers to optimize energy allocation, reduce waste, and promote efficient energy usage. By leveraging advanced AI models and innovative allocation algorithms, this research presents a promising avenue for enhancing energy efficiency and addressing the challenges associated with increasing energy consumption in today's world.
